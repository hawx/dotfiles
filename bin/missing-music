# I seem to have some tracks missing, for example, Track 2 on Suck It And See or
# Track 3 on Basscadet. I bet this has to do with my hubrical reorganisation of
# my whole library. This script should find all the albums in my collection with
# "gaps" that is tracks 1,2,..,i-1,i+1,...,n-1,n where n = total tracks. [If
# total tracks doesn't exist then assume we have the last track?] Then report
# the album name.
